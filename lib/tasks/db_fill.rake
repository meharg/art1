Artwork.create!(:legacy_id => '20020405b', :title => 'Consuming Fire - Freedom Series', :desc => 'This was painted during the Releasing the Prophetic Conference in May.  This painting began with a fairly representation drawing.  My daughter modeled.  I was trying to capture an individual totally open to whatever the Lord had. I began by flooding the white paper with a bold red wash.  The effect can be quite striking as the vivid red runs down the page.  Out of the red I carved the figure.  It was fun, but I was not sure what it was "about" until a friend shared a dream.  She was at the conference and the process of painting gave her insights into the dream.  She felt that I had painted her and her dream.  The following is from an e-mail she sent describing the dream.
Remember I told you about the dream I had interpreted at lunch (during the conference dream interpretation teams ministered) and what an impact your painting had. In the dream I was in the big house that sat on a hill. It had a glass wall on one side and there were about 50 people in the house. All of a sudden there were sirens and everyone in the house left to seek shelter, they were all in a panic. I was looking for something and it must have been more important than my life. I stopped and was gazing out the window wall and I could see was the tops of trees out over the countryside. The next thing I saw was like this orange wave of air coming toward me across the countryside. The next thing I know I am standing there with an angel on each side. It was as if they had been there all of my life. I turned to one and asked them (in a telepathic kind of way) "Am I dead?" and they both said yes. I asked them where my body was and they said that it wasn''t important. I said "But will my family and friends not know I am not there?" And they said that my friends and family will think that I still live in my body, so they won''t know where I am. That was all I can remember about the dream. I interpreted it that the orange light was the coming of Christ. Something like the scripture in Isaiah that says and the voice of the Lord stripped the forest
bare. It was a beautiful sight and I went directly into the realm of the spirit.', :price => '0', :category => 'Prophetic',:priority => '', :size => '22 x 30 unframed', :image => '20020405b Consuming Fire.JPG', :thumb_image => '20020405b Consuming Fire_sm.JPG', :medium => 'Watercolor')

A broken cage with escaping doves representing the cleaning of the temple.  The garden and sweat drops as blood.  The silver coins, all thirty of them.  The last supper with Jesus and the twelve.   The cup and the kiss of betrayal.  The crowing cock, the crown of thorns and the torn veil.  Finally ending with the empty tomb that is radiating victorious light and standing in front of the stone the Lamb.

As I stood next to a tall building I was relieved to see only friendly planes.  (They had the names of grocery stores on them!)  All the sudden to my right a large flock of birds took to the air.  Instead of swarming, they formed geometric patterns and then arrows.  As the bird arrows rose into the air they came together to form the Star of David.  They continued flying in the formation, twisting and turning, rising and diving but remained in formation through the sky.  It was a very cool dream.  I don''t yet have an interpretation, but a friend suggested that it might represent God calling His people together. Another friend suggested supply and provision was flying in, instead of warfare.

March 2003 I was in Odessa, Ukraine at the Messianic Jewish Bible Institute working with students there releasing prophetic arts.  I wanted to leave some art with the school and took this one because of the birds flying in formation of the start of David.

A year after being painted this paintings has found its home.  The Ukrainian people are so sweet and warm.

This is Mikal''s window.  The King''s daughter.  The King''s bride.  (The church!)  And she was looking DOWN at her bridegroom worshipping with abandon.  She did not understand and instead of seeking understanding she looked down and hardened her heart.  Her reward- barrenness.  OH CHURCH, BEWARE!

Ron Phillip''s book, "Awakened by the Spirit" was used to awaken understanding in my spirit.  I was born and bred Southern Baptist, but I always sensed there was more.  My Amplified Bible had stuff in it we did not talk about in Sunday School..  Ron Phillips, a good Southern Baptist, has written this marvelous book outlining the history of the Baptists and the moves of the spirit.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  He has a marvelous chapter in there about Mikal.  How she represents the church and what happens when we turn our backs on the passionate expressions of worship to God.  We don''t mean to.  It is just not what we are used to so we close our hearts.  

I painted this just before Tommy Tenney spoke at the AOI pastor''s conference.  I have read several of his books and they stir my heart mightily!  I have not yet experienced anything like I have read about in his books.  I have experienced the lack of bread in the house, but not the manifestations.  I wonder if that was Mikal''s problem.  She knew only lack, not the fullness of relationship with the bridegroom.  

The last thing I painted was the window frame.  I was asking myself what color jealousy was, the color of judgment.  I chose orange.  So often when we are judging others we don''t mean to do it.  It comes out of defensiveness and lack of understanding.  We don''t want to be left out and since we ARE we judge others.  I chose orange because it starts with red, the color of the blood on the doorpost that brought deliverance, but it is altered to become orange.  Deliverance altered to become bondage.  Judgement and jealousy are bondage.  Mikal''s view was the view from bondage.  

I pray each and every one of us would have the view of DELIVERANCE!  FREEDOM!

I live in Texas.  Our state flower is the bluebonnet, a magnificent flower.   Some years they are so abundant if you roll down your window driving down the road you can smell them from the highway. It is the multitude of blossoms all face up and open to the sun (SON!) that releases the fragrance beyond the planting.   A single flower bears the fragrance, but a single flower has to be plucked and sniffed to be noticed.  Together the sweet fragrance is released while each remains firmly planted, able to grow, mature and reseed for the next year.  

Maybe it is something we should consider.   While it is wonderful to be chosen and "sniffed" maybe there is blessing in the generational thinking that is not so much about an individual moment but about multiplication for the future!

Of all the Easter paintings this is often my favorite.  I love the colors that defy expectations.  The vibrating blue background reminds me of heaven.

My heart was to incorporate the previous three bible studies and the new 
study she was working on that studies the bride/groom relationship from 
a Jewish perspective. Aspects included in the painting are the obvious: 
Lion, lamb, Star of David, grape vine (I am the vine you are the 
branches), door with the blood, the rose of Sharon (which is in fact a 
lily), and lily of the valley. A little more subtle are the wine cups, 
pomegranates, the tree of life on the temple pillars. My FAVORITE part 
is the prayer shawl with tassels and the DOVE in the negative space of 
the prayer shawl. The background represents royalty, glory and the 
Bright and Morning Star. OH, and we can''t forget the River!

This was a challenging piece, trying to incorporate all the different 
aspects that Denise had in her heart. A spent as much time researching 
as I did painting. I tried to give it a ''Jewish'' feel because Restore 
My Heart explores the Jewishness of the Christian faith. It was 
challenging, but I am pleased with the results.

I pray that the Holy Spirit will restore hearts through my work and 
through the MotherWise (and FatherWise) bible studies.

MotherWise is a lifeline for mothers providing Biblical instruction and 
practical help that mothers need to thrive in today''s chaotic, changing 
world. A network of moms supporting moms.
Four wonderful studies are available through MotherWise. Videos and 
cassettes make facilitating easy. Mentoring moms facilitate smaller 
prayer groups and help bridge the generation gaps. MotherWise studies 
incorporate exercise(optional!), prayer, bible instruction and practical 
parenting skills. I highly recommend any or all of these studies to 
those seeking God''s truth for their lives.

I saw scripture on his wall, he memorizes a LOT of scripture and posts it on his walls while he is learning new verses, and the painting dropped into my mind.  (His banner over me is love.)  I went to sketch it and I had not brought any paper!  I RAN home and got back just before the worship began.  I did a QUICK sketch and began painting.  I was very disappointed after the service because there was no interpretation for the painting.  It seemed to be saying something I did not quite grasp.  I asked God for an interpretation and He gave me a very vivid dream that night.  In it the intercessors were sitting at computers e-mailing prayer requests to God.  The big gun intercessors were not getting through because the enemy knew who they were and was coming against them.  BUT the baby intercessors that were interceding because of the election were getting through.  Rick and I were walking around looking over their shoulders because we wanted to know what they were typing that was being so effective.  Their fingers were FLYING over the keys and when they hit return (as in an old fashioned type-writer) they prayers flew up to heaven.  But when we looked there were no words on the screen but bright bold colors.  The colors in my painting.  I knew then that the painting was about intercession.  The Hebrew words in the background are the names of God.   A few months later a friend shared a dream from about the same time where she and was under an overpass while a tornado was coming towards her.  While they were taking cover she was not afraid.  Out of the tornado shot sheets of color and Diane was catching them in her arms.  She understood the sheets of color to be prayers.

I saw the Holy Spirit as a young black woman sitting beneath the vine weeping.  The vine was planted right next to the river, a perfect location.  The vine was strong and vibrant, but beetles had come and cut the branches from the vine.   She was weeping because the branches had been cut and they were beginning to wither.   

This was a very literal picture of what was transpiring in my congregation.   It was early, very early process and the evidence of the cutting was not yet clear.  Branches cut don''t wither immediately, but the signs were there of future loss.   

Valley of Weeping was painted during a Tuesday corporate intercession meeting.  I set up on the floor in the back of the sanctuary in the dark so that I was completely alone and nobody could see.  For me it was an act of intercession.   Later I called one of the elders and tried to explain what I had seen, but he seemed not to hear me.   Sometimes all one can do is intercede.

Instead of seeing this as a sad painting, to me there is still promise in it.   The vine is not damaged.  The life giving river is close.   The enemy although effective is not hidden.   The damage will show and eventually action will be taken.

During a Tuesday night intercession meeting I painted Valley of Weeping,  a very literal rendition of a vision. Valley of Weeping was painted off in the back corner as an act of intercession and shared/seen by no one.   It was just me and God and lots of tears crying out for healing.

Sunday morning arrived and at first I thought I was supposed to paint the Valley of Weeping image.   I sketched out the painting utilizing one of the children as a model.  I looked at it.  He looked at it and I said, "It is too sad isn''t it?"  He agreed. I erased the weeping figure and drew a cross.  

God''s heart for the congregation was not that the branches would be disconnected from the Vine but that there would be solid connection and abundant fruit.   So instead of painting what I had seen, I painted God''s heart for that congregation. First I  painted the cross.  Then I started weaving charcoal lines up the cross and across the beams until the vine had completely engulfed the cross.   The hearty fruit was added along with the glorious sun rise.  

Promises of Fruit was painted as a prophetic word of hope to a congregation deeply divided and in great pain.   It has been several years since this work was accomplished.  The congregation is still divided.  So many, so very many have left, but God''s heart has not changed.   His heart is always Yes and AMEN! for all His children.

The carpet he was standing on was shaking back and forth and it was a test.   He would have to jump from the carpet into the air to get to the track.   He jumped and passed the test and began running on the track.   He was running and running and trying to catch up with God.  There were many tracks and some were tempting him, but he stayed on the straight track.   He saw some men who were smiling because they had found a short cut to God, but Roy found a better short cut.   He was almost catching God but could not quite catch God so he hollered, "Stop!" and God stopped and Roy was able to catch up to God who was a giant lion head and he crawled up on top of the God head.   Once he was on board God took off again.   Out of the lion mouth, as it raced forward the track was being built.   They were almost to heaven when God stopped and backed up on the track.  Then Jesus came who was like a big person head and Jesus got on the track and he sealed the track to heaven.  

Cool vision!   This was my small attempt to capture it and I painted it during the next day''s soaking session.   Roy is currently working on a series of paintings of the vision.   Charles Carrin told him that as he grew older God would reveal the meanings of the vision.   It sounds like a magnificent ride in store for Roy.

Artwork.create!(:legacy_id => '20021130d', :title => 'Passages', :desc => 'This was painted the last Saturday night in our "old sanctuary" at James Avenue Church and it is different from anything that I have done before.  While I was resting (sounds better than napping doesn''t it?) I was imagining bridges and ladders and stairs and windows and an open heaven.  NOT meaning that there is more than one way to heaven- CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY - but the paths He lays before us are different.  For some it will be the ladder, others the stairs, and others the bridge.  Some will move from one to another.  But for each of us a window into heaven is open.  

This was the last Saturday night in the old sanctuary, but it was not the end of the anointed happenings in that place, but we as a Body were passing to a new level in the Kingdom. 

My friend Jan got an interpretation for this painting and I want to include it below.  It was artistically typed, looking like bowls, and I hope I can capture that here:

This is a visual perspective of this room.  It is steps and passages to the new room for worship.  That is what this room has been.

It is the angles and shapes of the stained glass windows that have been our filters for light.  The painting''s focus color red is the one conspicuously absent member of the rainbow in the windows of this room.  It is the primary color of the new room for worship.

During the painting of this work, unseen by Gwen as she faced the window wall, another work of art was being created and shown.  On the wall in the front of the baptistry, from those same stained glass windows, a divine shadow show was being given.  It was a unique, one-
time display of worship images - lights, shapes, and silhouettes of lifted hands.  All reflected the glory of the worship of OUR GOD.

I bless you to boldly follow the passages set before you and many windows open into heaven along the way.', :price => '0', :category => 'Prophetic',:priority => '', :size => '22x30', :image => '20021130d.jpg', :thumb_image => '20021130d_sm.jpg', :medium => 'Watercolor')

There is a lovely (spiritually and physically) little girl in our congregation named Martha.  In my mind I could just see Martha, who does have a servant heart and bakes the best brownies, seated at the feet of Jesus.  I asked her to pose one Sunday morning before church and this is the painting resulting.  Later she shared with me a song her mom used to sing to her about Martha sitting at the feet of Jesus.  Martha is more beautiful than this painting, but it is a good start.  I think more will follow.

This piece is important to me in this artistic journey.  SOMETHING seems to be changing, transitioning and this is one of the first steps.  I can hardly wait to discover where I am going!

The purples and blues represent the wings of the cherubim sitting atop the ark guarding the mercy seat which contains the presence of the Lord.  I have been painting this in my mind since the summer of 2001 at the Christian Dance Fellowship USA convention.  

As Christmas approached this year my personal quiet time was in Hebrews.  My heart thrilled at the description of the Ark of the Covenant and the NEW Covenant- "an entirely new agreement so that those who are called and offered it may receive the fulfillment of the promised everlasting inheritance." 

I was compelled to depict a New Ark.  

This time the salvation was not in keeping the commands on a stone tablet, "will be imprinted on minds and engraved on hearts!"  Instead of a gold covered box, a humble manger filled with golden straw.  The Ark of the Covenant could not be touched by human hands.  The Ark of the New Covenant was filled with a human who is fully God.

In the New Covenant "all will know God!"  I was reminded that Jesus is always living to make petition with God and intercede with Him and intervene for me!

Painted Saturday December 21, 2002 during the corporate worship service at James Avenue Church I began working on it in the afternoon.  Earlier in the day I drew the image using a tjaunting tool and melted paraffin and beeswax.  It is an adventure to work with hot wax and batiking tools.  Control is difficult and once the wax touches the paper it cannot be moved. I prepared several images that day and painted them all Saturday night.  The wax forms dams on the paper and the paint can be applied with a great deal of freedom and speed.  The wax holds the white of the paper allowing the image to emerge regardless of what happens with the paint.  Abandon only begins to describe the feeling of applying the paint in this process.  The chemical compounds in the wax are similar to the fat offerings of the old testament.  The aroma is very slight and very pleasant.  When I am working with the melted wax I am reminded of the fat offerings.

God is giving me this picture of being strapped to a
huge blue gliding parachute.  One like you would run
off the top of a mountain and catch the wind and soar
over mountains and valleys, all of His beautiful
creation.  The parachute changes colors from time to
time because it is slightly translucent.  Depending on
how it catches the rays of the sun, it might be gold,
blue, green, yellow, orange, red.  The unique thing is
that you can''t look back at where you came from
because the wind, His wind is sending you forward. 
No, not just straight forward, because the wind
changes direction as it hits mountains, comes up out
of valleys and comes over and off of the oceans.  But
you can''t look back because if you do the parachute
will get all twisted.  But I''m so captivated by all
the beauty that He is showing me that I don''t even
think of looking back because I don''t want to miss
what is coming up next because it is all so beautiful,
magnificent, gracious, merciful, almighty, excellent.


I have always liked this ParaSailing painting but always had trouble explaining it. It was something I FELT more than knew. It was how worship was that day and should be and CAN BE every day - even at home. Oh, how I wish I walked in that every day. Don''t, but gonna!

Anyway, I get this newsletter from this guy who speaks at homeschool conventions. Great speaker. Good writer. Got some skewed ideas on men and women but I know he will work through that because he is a man after God''s heart. We can all use a bit of correction now and then. BUT this newsletter helped me UNDERSTAND THIS PAINTING!!!! WHEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! I KNEW it was a wheeeeeeeeee painting. I KNEW the Christian walk was supposed to be WHEEEEEEEEEEEE, but now I see that it is in the bible and I AM RIDING HIGH!!!!!

Second Timothy 3:16-17
says: All scripture is given by inspiration of God,
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness.*
That the man of God may be PERFECT,
thoroughly furnished unto all good works.**

Translations of that word "perfect" are so varied that
it''s confusing to most people. The NIV translates it
"complete." The NAS translates it "adequate."

  Perfect? Complete? ADEQUATE?

When three totally different words are used to describe
something, there''s only one thing to do: *look back at
the original Greek word the Apostle Paul used.*

The three most commonly used words for "perfect" in the
New Testament are:

 * **Teleios (complete in character, *grown up*)
  Katartizo (to restore to its *original condition*)
  *Artios* (to freshen up, *lifted*, loosened)*

*Paul uses the word "artios" here. The root word is "arti"
which is derived from "airo" and means "*to suspend*."*

  IT''S TIME TO SET SAIL

Now lest we get lost in arcane definitions, let me share
a thought with you that may be one of the most profound,
encouraging things you''ve heard:


  *The word "perfect" here comes from the same root word as our word "airplane." **
*It implies lifting-up, loosing from the bonds of something*, being cleaned-up from dirtiness.*

  The Greeks didn''t have a concept of flying
  contraptions, obviously, but they used the word
  *"airo" to describe the "lifting up" of an anchor so
  that a ship can* be free to sail.**

Are you ready for this? *_/*To be "perfect" and "equipped
for every good work" literally implies to be set free

This was one of the most intense painting situations I have experienced.  I painted this Saturday night after the funeral of Chad Everton who died a few days shy of his 17th birthday.  He was in our youth group and he is missed.  Driving home from the funeral I was asking God what to paint and I felt like God wanted me to paint Jesus stilling the storm.  

I got home and created my own storm, yelled at the kids about who knows what and was NOT feeling Christ-like to say the least.  
I locked myself in the bathroom and did the sketch.  Always before, I used photos, old paintings or one of my children as a model.  This time it had to be me.  This was going to be a very personal Jesus. Christ in me and I in Him.  

Later that evening my daughter calmed the storm and offered to do dishes and laundry so I could paint in peace.  I painted late Saturday night on the floor in the living room.  All the pieces came together in a very humbling experience.  In the midst of my personal emotional storm Jesus reached out to me and told me to BE STILL.  And He allowed me to paint a powerful and beautiful portrait of Himself.  I love Him so much!

while I am typing this one of the kids is taking advantage of me being distracted.  The result- a storm, but this time of shorter duration.  The enemy is not creative, but his methods can be effective. Greater is He who is IN ME ...

My intentions for this painting was to be intercession on behalf of myself, my church and the Body at large for a calming of the storm.  Instead it turned out to be a prophetic piece commanding myself, my church and the Body at large.  

I do sense that the storms raging round us now are not over and quite possibly have only begun.  But look at Jesus.  He looks serious but not concerned the least bit about the storm.  All His concern and energy is focused on US!!!  The eye contact is direct.  The reach purposeful and sure. He is our shelter in the storm.  He is the calm IN the storm.  The storms have a purpose.  It is time for us to grow up.  He won''t leave us or foresake us in the storm.  When the storm is over He will still be with us celebrating.

The night before I had painted a portrait of Jesus called "Be Still" and my intentions were for Jesus to command the storm to be still.  I had kept the portrait of Jesus hidden and 10 minutes before worship was over I picked up the portrait of Jesus and leaned him against the storm and sat down.  The effect was dramatic.  One of my friends was worried that I had gone too far.  He commented, "I was worried about how you were going to bring light back into the painting.  Then BOOM! there was Jesus."  It was the affect I had hoped for.

It went on to talk about the bronze belt and from there down being like fire.  Thus the fire skirt.  This was a REALLY fun painting to do.

(Painting on the larger paper is challenging and exiting.)

I read a book that early Christian art depicted birds as representing different people groups.  This bird is blue because I like blue and it worked with the painting!  A woman the night of the concert thought the bird represented the Holy Spirit and that I had missed it by not leaving it white.  But this is not the Holy Spirit descending but you and me being SET FREE!  Fly friends, FLY!!!

The first thought was to show Jesus'' hand with the nail through it and the sparrow sitting on the nail.  While I was looking for resource material for a picture of a hand I found Michelangelo''s "The Creation of Adam" and all the sudden I knew that I had to include God in the painting instead of just implying God.  The cross beam identifies Jesus. "The Creation of Adam" is so well known that the other hand is obviously God.  

My heart is to represent Jesus'' sacrifice on the cross as being our bridge to God.  Of course, the sparrow is us.  The little sparrow is resting on Jesus- oblivious to His condition - and about to hop over to stand on God''s hand.  Seeing His Son suffering, God still reaches out for the sparrow.  

If you look closely there is a red mark located on Jesus near the pulse.  This represents the nail scar.
